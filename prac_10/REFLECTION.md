# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy was inconsistent. Sometimes I underestimated how long a task would take, especially when it involved new concepts or debugging.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Over time, I became better at identifying parts of the task that might take longer, and I started to break down tasks into smaller steps before estimating.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that accurate estimates require considering setup time, debugging, and reviewing the work against requirements, not just the initial coding.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned to pay more attention to the style guide, code readability, and clear variable naming. Feedback from others often revealed details I overlooked.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I learned how to identify both strengths and areas for improvement in code. Reviewing othersâ€™ work also reinforced my own understanding of good coding practices.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

### Explanation
You have completed all the necessary files. The code structure is good, the logic is clear, the naming is standardized, the format is neat, and you have successfully used the basic data structures (dictionaries, sets). It is particularly commendable that you have attempted to split functions and handle input and output reasonably. This is a very good habit!



## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would add more real-world mini-project examples in the practicals so students can apply concepts in a context that feels closer to professional work.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I followed the instructions carefully, applied lecture concepts in my solutions, committed my work regularly to GitHub, and tested my code thoroughly before submission.
