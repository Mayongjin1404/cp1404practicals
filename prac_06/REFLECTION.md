I need to manage my time better and not leave work until the last day. I also want to ask for help sooner when I get stuck.

I test my code often and try different inputs. I also make sure to follow the style guide.

I need to stop copying code without fully understanding it. I want to learn how and why the code works.

What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?
It would be helpful to have more simple examples or short videos that explain each week's practical before starting.
