**Clean Code Learnings:**
- **Meaningful Naming:** Using clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and 
classes to make code self-documenting and easy to understand.  
- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Ensuring each function or class has one focused purpose, 
which makes the code easier to debug and maintain.  
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoiding duplicated code by using loops, functions, and 
classes, so changes need to be made in only one place, reducing errors.  
- **Consistent Style:** Following standard coding conventions (like PEP8) and the patterns 
taught in class for formatting, naming, and structure, resulting in cleaner and more readable 
code.
